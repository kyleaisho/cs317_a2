=== Observed behaviour ===

Describe in general words the observed behaviour of each of these servers and 
how it affects the video playback experience. Then explain what you believe is
happening and what is causing the described behaviour.

* FUNKY A
The server appears to have sent packets out slowly simulating low bandwidth which lead to pauses in the video.

* FUNKY B
The server behaves similar to A but more severe, there is more noticeable pauses in the playback.

* FUNKY C
The server is sending out packets in the wrong order. Since our player doesn't currently deal with this behaviour the frames jump back and forward.

* FUNKY D
This server behaves similar to C but is more severe, more packets are out of order and it appears they are out of order by greater numbers. This causes the frames to jump back farther.

* FUNKY E
The packets seem to be arriving in order and at a steady rate but are being sent very fast and the client is playing them as fast as it receives them.

* FUNKY F
The server is sending packets very slowly but at a steady rate so and the client plays them slow. This is resulting in a low framerate for the player.

* FUNKY G
The packets are arriving slowly and at an uneven rate so the video plays with a low framerate and pauses occassionaly.

* FUNKY H
The packets seem to be sent at an uneven rate, playback appears normal, then pauses, speeds up, then normal again in a cycle.

You may add additional columns with more relevant data.

FUNKY SERVER | FRAME RATE | PACKET LOSS RATE | OUT OF ORDER
             | (pkts/sec) | (lost pkts/sec)  | (/sec)
-------------+------------+------------------+-------------
     A       |    23      |      2           |   0

=== Result of analysis ===

Explain in a few words what you believe is actually happening based on the statistics above.

* FUNKY A
Losing a couple packets/frames per second, but the server is sending them at a normal speed.

* FUNKY B
Losing lots of packets (40% ish) but sending them at a normal speed.

* FUNKY C
Sending the packets at a normal speed but they are arriving and playing out of order.

* FUNKY D
Losing a lot of packets and sending some out of order. Similar to B but with out of order packets as well.

* FUNKY E
Sending too many frames per second, and the player plays them as they come in.

* FUNKY F
Sends too few packets per second.

* FUNKY G
Sends too few packets per second and loses some packets.

* FUNKY H
Slightly slower packet rate than normal and loses some packets.
